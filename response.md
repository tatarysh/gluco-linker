I have addressed your requests:

1.  **`GEMINI.md` file creation**: I have created a `GEMINI.md` file in the root of the repository to provide project-specific context and instructions for the Gemini CLI.

2.  **Vuetify3 components for inputs**: I have investigated the codebase and found that all input fields in `.vue` files are already using `v-text-field` components, which are part of Vuetify3. Therefore, the project is already adhering to the guideline of using Vuetify3 components for inputs.
